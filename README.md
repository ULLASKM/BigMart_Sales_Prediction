# Sales Prediction for Big Mart Outlets

The data scientists at BigMart have collected 2013 sales data for 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities. Also, certain attributes of each product and store have been defined. The aim is to build a predictive model and predict the sales of each product at a particular outlet.

Using this model, BigMart will try to understand the properties of products and outlets which play a key role in increasing sales.

Please note that the data may have missing values as some stores might not report all the data due to technical glitches. Hence, it will be required to treat them accordingly. 
 
## Evaluation Metric

Your model performance will be evaluated on the basis of your prediction of the sales for the test data (test.csv), which contains similar data-points as train except for the sales to be predicted. Your submission needs to be in the format as shown in sample submission.

We at our end, have the actual sales for the test dataset, against which your predictions will be evaluated. We will use the Root Mean Square Error value to judge your response.
